===================================================================

The Full Deck folder contains all that is necessary for the full deck, as the name implies.

The first 8 cards are named with numbers like this: 1_1_, 1_2_.
This is to show that these cards are double faced and should be printed differently.
1_1 is the front face to 1_2.
2_1 is the front face to 2_2.

Inside the Full Deck folder, there are 2 folders, one for card backs, with 4 options, and the other for tokens.

For the 2/2 White Blue Knights and 2/2 White Knights, they are all the same, I have the intention of printing them dual-sided, one side WB, the other W, but you can do whatever you prefer.

Each token with multiple arts can be found inside their respective folders.

===================================================================

Now for the Extra folder, it contains 1 folder per card that has alternate arts. Inside each folder, you will find each possible art for that card, so you can see the art present in the full deck as well as all other options.

The 3 talismans are regrouped in the same folder called Talismans, as the arts were made to go together between 2 different options.

If you want to replace your check lands for true duals, take a look at the True Duals folder.
